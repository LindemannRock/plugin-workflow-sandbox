# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Release-Please Test, please report it privately. **Do not open a public GitHub issue** — public disclosure before a fix is available puts other users at risk.

### Preferred: GitHub private advisory

[Open a private security advisory](https://github.com/LindemannRock/craft-plugin-workflow-sandbox/security/advisories/new). This routes the report directly to maintainers with no public visibility.

### Email fallback

If you can't use GitHub's private reporting, email **security@lindemannrock.com** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected version(s)
- Potential impact

We aim to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and provide a status update within **5 business days**.
